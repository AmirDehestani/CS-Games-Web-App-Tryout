## ðŸš€ Front-End Track

This track involves showing us your design and page organization skills! There are no strict requirements for what it needs to look like, but try and show off your creativity, and make sure to align your design with the website's function.

You may either directly work with React, HTML and CSS, or you may choose to instead design the website interfaces with Figma. **If you use Figma, please make sure to leave links to each of your created Figma pages in the "figma_folder" directory. Any resources you for that platform should be able to be stored/accessed in from that folder.**

### Task List

- [ ] **Create Custom Theming for the Website**  
  This task involves implementing a consistent theme across all existing pages, as well as any new pages that are added. The goal is to ensure a cohesive look and feel that aligns with the brand.

- [ ] **Create and Design a Page Showing the Types of Rooms and Services**  
  A page needs to be designed that clearly displays the various types of rooms and services available. This page should be user-friendly, making it easy for potential visitors to understand the options and select what they need.

- [ ] **Create and Design an About Us Page**  
  The About Us page should provide essential information about the company, mission, and team. This page should have some information on it relating to the Hotel business in some way.

## ðŸš€ Back-End Track

This track involves showing us your functionality and implementation skills! You will work with the existing (but non functional) pages related to the hotel rooms, and give them the ability to do what is described in the task list.

You may either directly work with React, HTML and CSS, or you may choose to instead design the website interfaces with Figma.

### Task List

- [ ] **Create Logic for Room Look-Up Page**  
  The logic for a room-look-up page will display information about the occupants of each room. Users should be able to easily search for a room and view relevant details, such as who is occupying it and for how long.

- [ ] **Create Logic to Book a Room and Assign a Customer**  
  A booking system will be developed to assign a customer to a specific room for a defined period. This includes processing the reservation, storing the relevant data, and ensuring that rooms are properly allocated based on availability.

- [ ] **Create Logic for a Calendar View for Room Availability**  
  A calendar view should be implemented for each room, showing availability in a visually accessible way. By clicking on a specific room, users should be able to see a detailed calendar with availability dates, which will allow for easy booking.
